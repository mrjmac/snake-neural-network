# Snake Neural Network

A neural network written completely from scratch in Java that is trained to play Snake.

In order to run, download and compile all files, then run test.java.

The neural network will take a few hours to train so leave your computer idled.

The neural network is trained using a genetic algorithim on a population size of 5000. The fitness function could probably use a little work, but it gets satisfactory results for now.
